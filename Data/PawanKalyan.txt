Pawan Kalyan, Andhra Pradesh's deputy CM and Janasena Party chief, announced Narasimha Varahi Brigade to protect Sanatana Dharma amidst recent controversies.
Janasena Party Chief and Andhra Pradesh deputy chief minister Pawan Kalyan announced the formation of a new party wing, the Narasimha Varahi Brigade, dedicated to protecting Sanatana Dharma. "I respect all religions, but I stand firm on my faith. Those who criticize Sanatana Dharma on social media or speak disrespectfully about it will have to face the consequences. Thus, I am establishing a dedicated wing within our party named the 'Narasimha Varahi Brigade' for the protection of Sanatana Dharma," Kalyan said, explaining the purpose of the new brigade. This announcement follows recent allegations regarding the use of adulterated ghee in the prasadam at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Tirumala. Last month, Kalyan advocated for a robust national law to protect Sanatana Dharma and prevent actions that disrespect its beliefs. At the Varahi Declaration event in Tirupati, he said, "A strong national Act is needed to protect Sanatana Dharma and prevent harm to its beliefs. This Act should be enacted immediately and enforced uniformly across Bharat." Pawan Kalyan proposed establishing a Sanatana Dharma Protection Board at both the national and state levels to oversee this lawâ€™s implementation, with dedicated funding for its activities. Additionally, he stressed the need for Sanatana Dharma Certification to ensure purity in materials used for temple offerings and prasadam.

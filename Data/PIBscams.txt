PIB has warned users about scams involving fake messages offering SBI rewards, advising against downloading unknown files. The government's Press Information Bureau (PIB) has issued a warning about recent scams targeting users for financial fraud. In a social media post, PIB cautioned users against fake messages claiming to offer SBI rewards. The bureau shared, "Did you also receive a message asking you to download & install an APK file to redeem SBI rewards?" PIB further clarified, "SBI never sends links or APK files over SMS/WhatsApp. Never download unknown files or click on such links," as part of its fact-check advisory aimed at protecting users from phishing attempts. Cyber fraud is on the rise, with people losing lakhs due to increasingly sophisticated tactics by fraudsters. The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has launched the “International Incoming Spoofed Calls Prevention System” in two phases last month. This system detects and blocks spam international calls that falsely display Indian numbers as caller IDs, addressing a key element that enables these scams.
